# Switchboard

A desktop app for organizing, managing, and automating agent coding
sessions. Built in Rust with [egui](https://docs.rs/egui) /
[eframe](https://docs.rs/eframe) from
[egui-app-template](../egui-app-template); design notes live in `docs/`.

Requires Rust 1.95 or newer.

## Development

```sh
cargo run --locked                                   # launch the app
cargo test --locked                                  # unit tests + headless UI tests
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings   # lint
cargo fmt --all                                      # format
```

### Layout

```
src/main.rs              thin launcher: logging, window options, run_native
src/lib.rs               module tree and the layering rules
src/core/                deterministic, egui-free
  action.rs              AppAction, Effect, Clock, AppCore::dispatch (the state machine)
src/ports/               traits the core needs from the outside world
  clipboard.rs           clipboard that reports failure
src/adapters/            real implementations plus fakes for tests
  clipboard.rs           arboard clipboard; FakeClipboard
src/app.rs               SwitchboardApp: owns core + adapters; runs effects, feeds results back
src/ui.rs                egui drawing and input -> actions
tests/ui.rs              headless flows via egui_kittest with fake adapters
```

The flow for any feature: the UI dispatches an `AppAction`; the core
updates its state and returns `Effect`s; the app runs each effect through
an adapter and dispatches the result as another action. Add a capability by
adding a port trait, a real adapter, a fake, and an `Effect` variant. The
core never touches egui, threads, files, or the network.

### Testing approach

Everything enters `AppCore::dispatch(action, clock)` and leaves as effects,
so core tests are plain state-transition tests with an explicit clock and
no sleeping. Adapters get their own tests where they have logic. UI tests
run the real `eframe::App` headlessly with fake adapters, find widgets by
label, and advance frames with `harness.run_steps(2)`: one frame to
process the click, one to render its result.

Tests that hit real services (a model, a paid API) go in their own
`tests/*.rs` file, marked `#[ignore]`, with the command to run them
documented here.

### Pre-commit hook

`.githooks/pre-commit` checks formatting, runs Clippy, and runs the tests
before each commit. It never modifies or stages files. Enable it once per
clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

### Secrets

Local secrets go in `.env` (ignored by git). Read them from the app at
startup; never bake them into the binary or commit them.
